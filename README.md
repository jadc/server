# server
A collection of Docker compose files I have written for use on my home server.

## Usage
Ensure you have Docker installed, then, clone this repository.

Run `docker compose up -d` in the root of the repository. This will run all the services.

The typical server files will be located in the `data` subdirectory within each service's directory. Do not commit this directory.
