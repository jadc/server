# server
A collection of Docker compose files I have written for use on my home server.

## Usage
Ensure you have Docker installed.

Then, clone this repository, and run `docker compose up -d` while within whichever directory corresponding to the service you want to run.

The typical server files will be located in the `data` directory. Do not commit this directory.
